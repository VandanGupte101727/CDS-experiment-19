c plus plus and data structures experiment 19

Aim:-to study and implement queue and its operations <br>

Software used:- VS code <br>

Theory:-<br>
A queue is a linear data structure that follows the First In, First Out (FIFO) principle, meaning the first element added is the first one to be removed. It can be visualized as a line of people waiting for a service where the person at the front gets served first.<br>

Basic Queue Operations:<br>
Enqueue: Adds an element to the rear (end) of the queue.<br>
Dequeue: Removes an element from the front of the queue.<br>
Front (Peek): Retrieves the front element without removing it.<br>
IsEmpty: Checks if the queue is empty.<br>
IsFull: Checks if the queue is full (in case of a bounded queue).<br>

CODE:-<br>
